# Velos

**Velos** is a control plane for running containers across a pool of registered
worker machines, exposed over a RESTful API. You declare the containers you want;
Velos schedules them onto healthy workers, runs them through a container runtime,
and continuously reconciles their actual state back toward what you asked for.

The architecture is runtime- and OS-agnostic: workers talk to the control plane
over HTTP and execute containers through a pluggable runtime interface. The
current runtime backend is [Apple Containerization](https://github.com/apple/containerization)
(lightweight Linux micro-VMs); additional runtimes and platforms are a planned
direction.

## Components

- **`velos-server`** — the control plane. Serves the REST API, persists objects
  in SQLite, runs the scheduler and reconciliation loops, and serves the web
  dashboard (embedded in the binary). Bind address and DB path are configurable
  via `--listen`/`VELOS_LISTEN` and `--db`/`VELOS_DB`.
- **`veloslet`** — the per-worker agent. Registers its machine, renews a lease to
  prove liveness, and reconciles its assigned containers against the runtime.
- **`velosctl`** — a command-line client for the API. `velosctl login` saves an
  admin token (and server URL) to `~/.velos/config` for subsequent calls.
- **Web dashboard** — a React UI for first-run admin setup, watching workers and
  containers, launching workloads, and managing CLI tokens, served directly by the
  server.

## Resource model

Velos manages three object types, each with `metadata` / `spec` / `status`, served
under `/api/v1/{plural}`:

- **Container** — a workload. Its phase moves `Pending → Scheduled → Running →
  Succeeded | Failed`, or `Unknown` when its node's state is lost.
- **Worker** — a registered machine, with its capacity and a `Ready` condition.
- **Lease** — a worker's periodic heartbeat; a stale lease marks its worker
  `NotReady`.

## Getting started

Install with cargo:

```bash
cargo install velos-server velosctl veloslet
```

…or build from source with `make build` (which also builds the embedded dashboard).

Then follow **[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)** for the full
walkthrough: start the control plane, set up the admin account and connect
`velosctl`, register a worker, launch containers, and open the dashboard at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`. On first run the dashboard prompts you to create the
admin account; from there you mint a CLI token for `velosctl`. (Running a worker
currently requires the Apple `container` CLI; the control plane, CLI, and
dashboard do not.)

## Development

```bash
make build        # build the web UI + workspace
make web          # rebuild just the web UI (embedded by the server)
make test         # cargo test --workspace
make check        # fmt --check + clippy -D warnings + test  (pre-PR gate)
make run          # run the server
make install-ctl  # install velosctl into ~/.cargo/bin
make install-let  # install veloslet into ~/.cargo/bin
```
